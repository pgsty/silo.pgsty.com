已归档的 MinIO Operator 项目曾发布 [Operator Chart](https://github.com/minio/operator/tree/v7.1.1/helm/operator) 与 [Tenant Chart](https://github.com/minio/operator/tree/v7.1.1/helm/tenant)。本页记录其最终 `v7.1.1` Operator Chart。

本页说明 MinIO Operator 的 `values.yaml` 图表。 有关 MinIO 租户图表的文档，请参见 [租户 Helm Charts](/zh/reference/tenant-chart-values/#minio-tenant-chart-values)

> [!WARNING]
> 上游 MinIO Operator 仓库已于 2026 年 3 月 20 日归档。请将这些配置视为冻结的 `v7.1.1` 参考快照，而不是上游仍在维护或提供支持的依据。
